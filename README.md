# Looking for Suspicious Transactions

This file accompanies Visual Data Analysis notebook being provided to my FinTech Company CFO.

## Goal of This Notebook 
The goal of these analysis tools is to provide information about possible fraud patterns.

### Part I - Vidual Data Analysis

Fraudsters sometimes make several small transactions on a credit card in order to avoid being caught. I isolated those transactions for each cardholder in Sql using the groupby function, and counted the number of transactions for each cardholder. Here are those results:

| ccd_owner_id | number_ignored |
|--------------|----------------|
| 1            | 10             |
| 2            | 11             |
| 3            | 3              |
| 4            | 16             |
| 5            | 14             |
| 6            | 6              |
| 7            | 18             |
| 8            | 15             |
| 9            | 3              |
| 10           | 20             |
| 11           | 21             |
| 12           | 26             |
| 13           | 19             |
| 14           | 9              |
| 15           | 12             |
| 16           | 19             |
| 17           | 4              |
| 18           | 19             |
| 19           | 22             |
| 20           | 18             |
| 21           | 4              |
| 22           | 7              |
| 23           | 16             |
| 24           | 22             |
| 25           | 16             |

Several of the cards do have a large number of those transactions. The card holders with the most small transactions are # 12, # 19 and # 24. The high quantities of small transactions for those card holders suggests that their cards have been hacked. 

### Part II - Interactive Visualizations Dashboard

# Acknowledgements

I would like to first acknowledge the guidance and teaching of our FinTech Boot Camp Instructor, Garth Mortensen, our TA, Alejandro Esquivel, and out Student Success Manager, Angelica Baraona. I also found the collective Stack Overflow wisdom essential as ever. Regarding postgreSQL and PGAdmin4 overall I utilized information from codemy and the tech website collective in general. In dealing with a new environment combining PyViz and Sql, the RealPython.com's Vritual Environments Primer was interesting. Finally, the SQL books were helpful as I continued my learning process.
