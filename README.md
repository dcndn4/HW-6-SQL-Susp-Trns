# Acknowledgements

I would like to first acknowledge the guidance and teaching of our FinTech Boot Camp Instructor, Garth Mortensen, our TA, Alejandro Esquivel, and out Student Success Manager, Angelica Baraona. I also found the collective Stack Overflow wisdom essential as ever. Regarding postgreSQL and PGAdmin4 overall I utilized information from codemy and the tech website collective in general. In dealing with a new environment combining PyViz and Sql, the RealPython.com's Vritual Environments Primer was interesting. Finally, the SQL books were helpful as I continued my learning process.
